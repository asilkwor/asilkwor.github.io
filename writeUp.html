Hate Crime in America<br>

Hate crime in the United States of America is an ugly reality that often times isn’t understood or<br>
even reported. Our group decided to look into this awful subject matter and see what we could learn about<br>
the topic. We were able to get our data set from https://github.com/emorisse/FBI-Hate-Crime-Statistics -<br>
after looking at the data we thought up with 3 questions that we wanted to answer from the data.<br>
1. Where do the hate crimes happen most often?<br>
2. What types of hate crimes are reported to the FBI?<br>
3. Do all states report hate crimes to the FBI?<br>
With these questions in mind, we wanted a way to visualize our data from the FBI. Using a json<br>
script for a map of the United States, we then linked the file to D3. This allowed us to develop a map of<br>
the United States that gave the user mouse over interactions. After that, dove deeper into the data and<br>
knew we needed to create different categories. These categories were to show the different types of hate<br>
crimes that are reported across the US. For these numbers, we performed calculations using the data.<br>
Adding up each attribute and dividing by 100,000 to give each state it’s numeric value per 100k. In order<br>
to visualize these categories, we used colors for each channel. We choose colors for each attribute and we<br>
decided on preventing the colors from being biased themselves. We chose blue for the home screen since<br>
it naturally displays well. Green was chosen for race, orange chosen for religion, purple for sex, red for<br>
ethnicity, greyscale for disability, purple again for gender due to the inherent relation to sex, and<br>
greyscale again for gender identification.<br>
The categories are neatly grouped together under a master drop-down menu on the top right of the<br>
page. This allows for the user to specifically choose which type of hate crime they wish to display. On the<br>


other side of the page we have another menu, this is the navigation of the site. The navigation menu<br>
allows the user to navigate to the write up and video sections of the website.<br>
Now that a fully functioning visualization is created – the answers to the previously stated<br>
questions should start to materialize. The questions were -<br>
1. Where do the hate crimes happen most often?<br>
2. What state has the least amount of hate crime reported?<br>
3. Do all states report hate crimes to the FBI?<br>
Looking at the map, the answer to the first question can now be answered – Delaware. The smallest state<br>
of the country reports 15.4214 hate crimes per 100k people. The next question is to discover what state<br>
has the least amount of hate crime reported. The answer from the data set is Texas, with 1.3668 hate<br>
crimes reported per 100k. However, there are states that do not report their hate crimes at all to the FBI.<br>
This gives them a value of 0. Hawaii, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, North Carolina, South<br>
Carolina, West Virgina, New Jersey, New York, and New Hampshire all do not report hate crimes to the<br>
FBI. There is a total of 9 different states that aren’t reporting the hate crimes that take place. As a group,<br>
we found that to be alarming.<br>
In closing, using D3 and our data set we were able to visualize hate crime across our country. The<br>
different types of hate crime and which states are reporting these crimes. Our questions were answered<br>
through using the visualization. We hope to inspire others to learn more about this topic and help those<br>
who may be affected by hate crime in the United States of America.<br>
